For code structure style, "tidyverse" is used. This tidyverse style originally was derived from Googleâ€™s R style guide, but has evolved and expanded considerably over the years. Two R packages support this style guide:

- "styler" allows you to interactively restyle selected text, files, or entire projects. It includes an RStudio add-in, the easiest way to re-style existing code.

- "lintr" performs automated checks to confirm that your conform to the style guide.
